# RAG Project

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that utilizes the Gemini language model (LLM) to create a chatbot capable of answering queries based on a knowledge base. The knowledge base is built from data stored in the `data` folder.

├── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies for the project
└── README.md                # Documentation for the project
```

## Data Formats

You can store your data in various formats, including:

- **Plain Text**: Simple text files (.txt) for unstructured data.
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values files (.csv) for structured tabular data.
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation files (.json) for hierarchical data structures.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rag-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your data files in the `data` folder.

## Usage

To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```
python src/chatbot.py
```

Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot. The RAG model will utilize the data provided in the `data` folder to generate responses based on user queries.

## RAG Model Overview

The RAG model combines retrieval and generation techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. It retrieves information from the knowledge base and uses the Gemini LLM to generate human-like responses based on the retrieved data.
